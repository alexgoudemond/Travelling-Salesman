# Travelling-Salesman
Here is a small project where I try and create a program which can solve the travelling salesman problem using Simulated Annealing! I may add other solutions later

My goal is to try create an interactive map, where I can generate cities (probably on a Cartesian Plane, using my mouse or my finger) and then run the code to find a short path! I am aware of Simulated Annealing as one way to solve this, but I will explore other options as well

A quick glance online suggests: Brute-Force (I will avoid this), Branch-and-Bound, Nearest-Neighbour and Simulated-Annealing (Amongst others!)

<!--
    OKAY! The goal here is to try and write some programs that can try solve the Travelling Salesman Problem, interactively.

    My goal is to have a Cartesian Plane on my webpage, with one city placed on it by default.
        Perhaps there will be buttons underneath to clear all the cities?
    
    Then, I need to create code that allows the user to add a city (a point on the plane) using their mouse.
        Perhaps there should be a limit to some number of cities - maybe 15?

    Once I have that working, I can look at different ways to approach an optimal path!
        Perhaps I have an external JS document (or 3), containing all my functions?
            Different strategies: Branch-and-Bound, Nearest-Neighbour and Simulated-Annealing
    
    There should be a few buttons somewhere to choose a solution type, as well as a button to say "Stop!"

    It would be dope if the graph danced as paths were explored... How much work to make this possible?
        This is the fun part I really want to implement!
