# Travelling-Salesman
Here is a small project where I try and create a program which can solve the travelling salesman problem using Simulated Annealing! I may add other solutions later

My goal is to try create an interactive map, where I can generate cities (probably on a Cartesian Plane, using my mouse or my finger) and then run the code to find a short path! I am aware of Simulated Annealing as one way to solve this, but I will explore other options as well

A quick glance online suggests: Brute-Force (I will avoid this), Branch-and-Bound, Nearest-Neighbour and Simulated-Annealing (Amongst others!)
