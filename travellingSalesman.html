        OKAY! The goal here is to try and write some programs that can try solve the Travelling Salesman Problem, interactively.

        My goal is to have a Cartesian Plane on my webpage, with one city placed on it by default.
            Perhaps there will be buttons underneath to clear all the cities?
        
        Then, I need to create code that allows the user to add a city (a point on the plane) using their mouse.
            Perhaps there should be a limit to some number of cities - maybe 15?

        Once I have that working, I can look at different ways to approach an optimal path!
            Perhaps I have an external JS document (or 3), containing all my functions?
                Different strategies: Branch-and-Bound, Nearest-Neighbour and Simulated-Annealing
        
        There should be a few buttons somewhere to choose a solution type, as well as a button to say "Stop!"

        It would be dope if the graph danced as paths were explored... How much work to make this possible?
            This is the fun part I really want to implement!
